      &#8226; I just learned about html so i thought why not to try and make a webpage of own and have a taste. So i continued to make the webpage it took more than 4-5 hours to make the first page only and this is the second page i am making , which you are reading currently.

      I didn't thought this would be this much hard to make an webpage ,to make the alignment of the images and div's , seems very diifficult for a newbie but at the same time it is also pretty much enjoying , as doing the all the stuffs by ownself , feels like an actual programmar.
